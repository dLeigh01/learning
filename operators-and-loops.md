# Operators and Loops
## Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions
You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you might expect it to be, resulting in a Boolean.
* `==` is equal to
* `!=` is not equal to
* `===` is strictly equal to
* `!==` is strictly not equal to
* `>` is greater than
* `<` is less than
* `>=` is greater than or equal to
* `<=` is less than or equal to
## Logical Operators
Comparison operators usually return single boolean values, while logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
* `&&` Logical and
* `||` Logical or
* `!` Logical not
## Loops
Loops check a condition. If it returns true a code block will run, then the condition will be checked again and continue to run until it returns false.
* For loop
    * Runs a specific number of times, as defined in the condition counter
* While loop
    * Code will continue to loop an undefined amount of time for as long as the condition remains true
* Do while loop
    * A while loop that will always run at least once even if it evaluates to false.
## Loop Counters
A for loop uses a counter as a condition that tells the code to run a specific number of times and is made up of three statements
* Initialization
    * Create a variable and set it to 0 `var i = 0`
* Condition
    * The loop should continue to run until the counter reaches a certain number `i < 10`
* Update
    * Every time the loop has run it adds one to the counter `i++`
